## Launching SARA Book Club - An Inclusive Book Club

Inspired by the SARA Institute's mission to make data science accessible to all, we are starting a collaborative reading initiative for anyone passionate about books.

### Why This Matters:

Data science education has historically been the privilege of a few. Through SARA Book Club, we're creating space where:

→ Knowledge is democratized, not gatekept.  
→ All backgrounds are valued and welcomed.   
→ Learning happens through community, not isolation.    
→ Data skills become tools for social impact.    

### The Format:

- One book per month.      
- Bi-weekly Zoom discussions (every 15 days).   
- Inclusive, respectful learning environment.        
- Free participation - no barriers.

### Who Should Join:

Students, researchers, professionals, career changers, activists, scholars - anyone committed to learning and sharing knowledge equitably.

**In the Spirit of Mata Savitribai Phule & Mata Ramabai Ambedkar**:
This isn't just a book club. It's a space to build the diverse, inclusive data science community our field desperately needs.
