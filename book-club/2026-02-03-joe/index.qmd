📚 We're starting SARA Book Club with an inspiring choice!

### Book: Unmasking AI: My Mission to Protect What Is Human in a World of Machines

### Author: [Dr. Joy Buolamwini](https://www.linkedin.com/in/buolamwini/)   


Dr. Buolamwini is the founder of the [The Algorithmic Justice League](https://www.ajl.org/about) and her book exposes how AI systems encode discrimination against women, people of color, and marginalized communities. She uncovered what she calls "the coded gaze"—the evidence of encoded discrimination and exclusion in tech products.

Why this book? Perfect alignment with SARA's values of justice, accessibility, and making tech serve everyone - not just the privileged few.
