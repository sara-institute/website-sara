    "text": "Summer School ‚ÄúR for Beginners‚Äù 22 - 26 July 2024\n\n\nThe SARA institute helped me to overcome the fear over computers. I never did any course such as MS-CIT but enrolling myself directly to study basic coding and R programming language with SARA helped me to be confident about it. Now I understand that everything is possible using the programming language and more efficiently. The knowledge that is kept away from the marginalized communities due to the high cost, SARA institute bridges that gap and makes it available to our students who can‚Äôt afford it. I would request everyone to enroll yourself for the future courses because you will get a lot to learn and will be much more confident with the new age technologies.\n‚Äî Avichal Warke, PhD Scholar, JNU\n\n\nFirst of all thank you so much for a brilliant workshop. Dr.¬†Ajay sir has a great sense of humour which makes the lecture very accessible. Thanks a lot for making data science interesting. I learned a lot and have a wonderful time with everyone. The study material used in the workshop is outstanding, teaching style is clear, beautiful and nice. This was a fabulous event.\n‚Äî Akansha Singh, MSc Bioinformatics, UP"

As someone from a social sciences background, I was initially apprehensive about learning statistics and R. However, Ajay Sir‚Äôs clear and patient explanations, starting from the basics, made the concepts easy to understand and much less intimidating. He ensured that we not only understood the theoretical aspects of statistics but also gained practical experience using R, which made the entire learning process much more approachable. The overall experience was fantastic, with great accommodation and delicious food. I highly recommend this workshop to anyone looking to learn statistics and R.\n‚Äî Sapna Kanwar, MA, JNU\n\n\nI really enjoyed the workshop. It is a full package that teaches us to integrate three skills: understanding Research Methodology, knowledge of statistics and use of R for data analysis. To teach all these skills in five days is a tedious task and Dr Ajay Koli has done a commendable job. Facilities for food and accommodation are wonderful.\n‚Äî Dharmanshu Dhakar, PhD Scholar, MP"
