The 2nd SARA Bootcamp brings together researchers, students, and academics for three days of intensive, practical learning on how to write, format, and publish research using Quarto and R - two of the most powerful open-source tools in modern research communication.

SARA believes research produced by and about marginalized communities must be heard. This bootcamp equips you with the tools to publish that research professionally, reproducibly, and beautifully.
